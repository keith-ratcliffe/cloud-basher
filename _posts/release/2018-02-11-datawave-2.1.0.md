## **NOTE**
DataWave 2.1.0 hasn't actually been released yet. For now, this post is intended only to demonstrate the release docs and
procedures for updating the site.

The source file for this post is **{{ page.path }}**

Note that the *frontmatter* section of this file sets **draft: true**

Try setting **draft: false**. If you do, then links to this post will magically show up in the news feed, in the release archive,
and also on the home page in the "Latest News" panel. The "draft release notes" warning at the top of this post will also
go away

As with other page types in this site, page layout and other default properties for 'release'
posts are configured via /**_config.yml**
