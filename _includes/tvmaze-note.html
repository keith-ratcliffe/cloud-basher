    The dataset used for this example is from [tvmaze.com/api](http://tvmaze.com/api). During the quickstart setup,
    [this data file](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/datawave/blob/master/warehouse/ingest-json/src/test/resources/input/tvmaze-api.json)
    was ingested via the quickstart's [datawaveIngestJson](../getting-started/quickstart-reference#datawave-ingest-functions)
    function for demonstration purposes. The raw file was created by issuing queries such as
    [http://api.tvmaze.com/singlesearch/shows?q=seinfeld&amp;embed=cast](http://api.tvmaze.com/singlesearch/shows?q=seinfeld&amp;embed=cast)
    for a variety of TV shows and concatenating the returned JSON objects into a single file
