    At ingest time, DataWave creates/maintains a data dictionary
    ([https://localhost:8443/DataWave/DataDictionary](https://localhost:8443/DataWave/DataDictionary)) of known data types
    and their associated field names. A typical DataWave query expression will leverage one or more of these field names to
    find data of interest
