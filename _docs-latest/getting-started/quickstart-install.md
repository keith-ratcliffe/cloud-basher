tags: [getting_started]
toc: false
summary: |
  <p>This quickstart provides a standalone DataWave instance that you may use to follow along with the
  <a href="../tour/getting-started">guided tour</a>. It is also generally useful as a development tool, as it provides a
  consistent, repeatable process for deploying and testing DataWave locally.</p>
  <p>The quickstart provides setup and tear-down automation for DataWave, Hadoop, Accumulo, ZooKeeper, and Wildfly,
  and it includes many <a href="quickstart-reference">utility functions</a>, which will streamline most interactions
  with these services.</p>

## Before You Start

### Prerequisites

* Linux, Bash, and an Internet connection to `wget` tarballs

### System Recommendations

* OS: To date, this quickstart has been tested on CentOS 6x, 7x and Ubuntu 16x
* 8GB RAM + single quad-core processor (minimum)
* Storage: To install everything, you'll need at least a few GB free
* ulimit -u (max user processes): 32768
* ulimit -n (open files): 32768
* vm.swappiness: 0

### Get the Source Code

or <a class="btn btn-success" style="width: 220px;" href="{{ site.repository_url }}/" role="button" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github fa-lg"></i> Clone the Repo</a>

{% include note.html content="The local path that you select for DataWave's source code will be refererred to as
**DW_SOURCE** from this point forward. Wherever it appears in a bash command below, be sure to substitute it with the
actual path" %}

### Docker Alternative

If you would prefer to run the DataWave Quickstart environment as a Docker container, skip the 4 steps described below.
Go [here][dw_docker_alternative] instead and view the *README* file. Note that the *[Override Default Binaries](#override-default-binaries)*
section below is also relevant to the Docker image build.

---

## Quickstart Setup

```bash
  $ echo "source DW_SOURCE/contrib/datawave-quickstart/bin/env.sh" >> ~/.bashrc   # Step 1
  $ source ~/.bashrc                                                              # Step 2
  $ allInstall                                                                    # Step 3
  $ datawaveWebStart && datawaveWebTest                                           # Step 4
  # Setup is now complete
```

The four commands above will complete the entire quickstart installation. However, it's a good idea
to at least skim over the sections below to get an idea of how the setup works and how to customize it
for your own preferences.

To keep things simple, **DataWave**, **Hadoop**, **Accumulo**, **ZooKeeper**, and **Wildfly** will be installed under your
*DW_SOURCE/contrib/datawave-quickstart* directory, and all will be owned by / executed as the current user.

{% include important.html content="If you currently have any of the above installed locally under *any* user account,
you should ensure that all are stopped/disabled before proceeding" %}

### Step 1: Update ~/.bashrc

#### 1.1 Add the Quickstart Environment

This step ensures that your DataWave environment and all its services will remain configured correctly across
bash sessions.

```bash
  $ echo "source DW_SOURCE/contrib/datawave-quickstart/bin/env.sh" >> ~/.bashrc  # Step 1
```

The *[env.sh][dw_blob_env_sh]* script is a wrapper that bootstraps each service in turn by sourcing its
respective *{servicename}/boostrap.sh* script. These scripts define supporting bash variables and functions,
encapsulating configuration and functionality consistently for all services.

#### 1.2 Override Default Binaries

To override the quickstart's default version of a particular binary, simply override the desired *DW_\*_DIST_URI* value
as shown below. URIs may be local or remote. Local file URI values must be prefixed with *file://*

```bash
  $ vi ~/.bashrc
     ...
  
     export DW_HADOOP_DIST_URI=file:///my/local/binaries/hadoop-x.y.z.tar.gz
     export DW_ACCUMULO_DIST_URI=http://some.apache.mirror/accumulo/1.x/accumulo-1.x-bin.tar.gz
     export DW_ZOOKEEPER_DIST_URI=http://some.apache.mirror/zookeeper/x.y/zookeeper-x.y.z.tar.gz
     export DW_WILDFLY_DIST_URI=file:///my/local/binaries/wildfly-10.x.tar.gz
     export DW_JAVA_DIST_URI=file:///my/local/binaries/jdk-8-update-x.tar.gz
     export DW_MAVEN_DIST_URI=file:///my/local/binaries/apache-maven-x.y.z.tar.gz

     source DW_SOURCE/contrib/datawave-quickstart/bin/env.sh     # Added by Step 1

     # If building the quickstart docker image, you only need the exports, no need to source env.sh
     
```

</div>

<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="bootstrap-env" markdown="1">
### Step 2: Bootstrap the Environment
```bash
  $ source ~/.bashrc                                                           # Step 2
```
As soon as *~/.bashrc* is sourced as shown above, tarballs for registered services will be automatically copied/downloaded
from their configured locations into their respective service directories, i.e., under *datawave-quickstart/bin/services/{servicename}/*.

A DataWave build will also be kicked off automatically.
DataWave's ingest and web service binaries will be copied into place upon conclusion of the build. This step can take
several minutes to complete, so now is a good time step away for a break.

{% include note.html content="The **DW_DATAWAVE_BUILD_COMMAND** variable in [datawave/bootstrap.sh][dw_blob_datawave_bootstrap_mvn_cmd]
defines the Maven command used for the build. It may be overridden in *~/.bashrc* or from the command line as needed" %}
</div>

<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="install-services" markdown="1">
### Step 3: Install Services
```bash
  $ allInstall                                                                 # Step 3
```
The `allInstall` bash function will initialize and configure all services in the correct sequence. Alternatively,
individual services may be installed one at a time, if desired, using their respective `{servicename}Install` bash functions.

</div>

<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="wildfly-test" markdown="1">
### Step 4: Start Wildfly and Test Web Services
```bash
  $ datawaveWebStart && datawaveWebTest                                        # Step 4
```

This will start up DataWave Web and run [preconfigured tests][dw_web_tests] against
DataWave's REST API. Note any test failures, if present, and check logs for error messages
</div>
