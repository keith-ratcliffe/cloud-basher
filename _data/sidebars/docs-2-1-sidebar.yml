# This file is used to construct the 'docs' sidebar for DataWave 2.1. Note that if the sidebar 'version' below
# matches that of site.latest_minor_release (in _config.yml), then _includes/sidebar.html will append "(Latest)" to the
# sidebar heading for us automatically

# General sidebar notes...

# The goal here is to have sidebar setup for our various collection types, and for our various versions of DataWave
# docs, be dynamic and data-driven rather than static-html-driven.

# Using the Navgoco jQuery component as its basis, the sidebar code in _includes/sidebar.html will build the
# accordion-style menu using the data provided below.

# The code supports nesting up to 2 levels deep...could easily support more, but it probably impedes usability to
# exceed 2 levels of nesting

# Note that sidebar selection for each web page is typically defaulted in _config.yml based on the page's collection type.
# However, the sidebar may be overridden, if needed, in the frontmatter section of the given page/post/doc/etc
